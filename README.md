The Animal Intake program was created with Java. 

The code was partially completed and built upon to meet client requirements. Prior to working on the program, UML diagrams were created to ensure a proper understanding of client needs. 

The program functionality includes keeping record of intake animals, tracking animals through training and job assignment, and updating animal availabilty.
